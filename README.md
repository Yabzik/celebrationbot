# The daily holiday notification bot

This project was originally conceived as a Telegram bot that sends a picture of today's holiday every day. The picture contains a caption and a random sticker from a list of images. You can try out the [bot in Telegram](https://t.me/whatistodaybot) right now. 
In addition, an open documented [API](https://api.yabzik.online/holidays/docs) is available at the moment.
